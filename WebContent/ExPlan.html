<p>Pregnancy might seem like the perfect time to sit back and relax. You likely feel more tired than usual, and your back might ache from carrying extra weight. But unless you're experiencing complications, sitting around won't help. In fact, pregnancy can be a great time to get active â€” even if you haven't exercised in a while.</p>
<p>These days, maintaining and even improving fitness levels is encouraged while pregnant, especially as exercise has a number of benefits such as boosting mood and energy levels, supporting better sleep, helping prevent excess weight gain and increasing stamina and muscle strength.</p>
<p>Regular exercise during your pregnancy can also improve heart health and stamina, as well as overall health. Maintaining a healthy body and healthy weight gain can help reduce common pregnancy complaints and discomforts like lower back pain, fatigue and constipation and may even help make labor a little easier by improving endurance.</p>
<p>Before embarking on any exercise during pregnancy, it is important to first consult your health care provider. If you have been participating in a regular exercise regimen and are having a healthy pregnancy, there should not be a problem continuing with your regimen in moderation. You may have to modify your exercise according to your trimester of pregnancy.</p>
<p>If you have not participated in an exercise regimen three times a week before getting pregnant, do not jump into a new, strenuous activity. Start out with a low-intensity activity and gradually move to a higher activity level.</p>
<p>Moderate exercise during pregnancy <em>"may give your baby a healthier start"</em>. The best type of exercise during pregnancy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A stroll around the neighborhood is a great way to start exercising during pregnancy. Your heart rate will increase steadily without too much impact on your knees and ankles.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increases your heart rate steadily and improves your heart circulation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keeps you flexible and limber.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Supports healthy weight gain and prevents excess weight gain by burning calories.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prepares your muscles for labor and birth.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Will not cause you to push your body too hard.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Research shows that healthy pregnant women who exercise during their pregnancy may:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have a lower risk of gestational diabetes and hypertension.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have less risk of preterm labor and birth</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have a shorter labor process</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be more likely to have a natural birth</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be less likely to need pain relief</strong></li>
<li><strong>Recover from childbirth faster.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Regular, moderate exercise not only makes for a healthier pregnancy, it may also give babies a healthier start. Research shows that when pregnant women exercise, their developing babies have a much lower heart rate. Babies of active moms may also have a healthier birth weight, a lower fat mass, improved stress tolerance and advanced neurobehavioral maturation.</p>
<p>Experts recommend that you exercise for 30 minutes a day, on most days. Most exercises are safe to perform during pregnancy, as long as you exercise with caution and do not overdo it.</p>
<p>Your pregnancy exercise regimen should strengthen and condition your muscles. Always begin by warming up for 5 minutes and stretching for 5 minutes. Following your choice of exercise, finish your regimen with 5-10 minutes of gradually slower exercise that ends with gentle stretching.</p>

<h2>Use common sense:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid exercise that involves lying on your stomach or flat on your back after the first trimester of pregnancy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stay well hydrated and drink plenty of fluids before, during and after you exercise</strong></li>
<li><strong>Avoid overheating and humidity, especially during the first trimester when the fetus is undergoing its most important growth and development</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stop exercising if you feel fatigued, develop persistent pain or experience any vaginal bleeding; check with your health care provider if regular contractions occur more than 30 minutes after exercise (possibly a sign of pre-term labor)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Avoid heavy weightlifting and any activities that require straining</strong></li>
<li><strong>Avoid exposure to extremes of air pressure, as in high altitude exercise (unless you are accustomed to it) or scuba diving</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not increase the intensity of your workout beyond pre-pregnancy intensity level</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day. According to the <a href="http://www.acog.org/">American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>, a pregnant woman of normal weight who gets less than 30 minutes of exercise a week should strive for a caloric intake of 1,800 during the first trimester, 2,200 during the second trimester and 2,400 during the third trimester.</strong></li>

</ul>
<h2>Recommended:</h2>
<p>The safest and most productive activities to perform during your pregnancy are brisk walking, swimming, indoor stationary cycling, prenatal yoga and low-impact aerobics (taught by a certified aerobics instructor).</p>
<p>These activities carry little risk of injury, benefit your entire body, and can be continued until the birth of your baby. Other activities such as jogging can be done in moderation. You might want to choose exercises or activities that do not require great balance or coordination, especially later in your pregnancy.</p>
<p>For most pregnant women, at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise is recommended on most, if not all, days of the week.</p>
<p>Walking is a great exercise for beginners. It provides moderate aerobic conditioning with minimal stress on your joints. Other good choices include swimming, low-impact aerobics and cycling on a stationary bike. Strength training is OK, too, as long as you stick to relatively low weights.</p>
<p>Remember to warm up, stretch and cool down. Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated, and be careful to avoid overheating.</p>
<p>Intense exercise increases oxygen and blood flow to the muscles and away from your uterus. In general, you should be able to carry on a conversation while you're exercising. If you can't speak normally while you're working out, you're probably pushing yourself too hard.</p>
<p>Begin with as little as five minutes of physical activity a day. Build up to 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and so on, until you reach at least 30 minutes a day.</p>

<h2>Staying motivated</h2>
<p>You're more likely to stick with an exercise plan if it involves activities you enjoy and fits into your daily schedule. Consider these simple tips:</p>
<p>Start small. You don't need to join a gym or wear expensive workout clothes to get in shape. Just get moving. Try a daily walk through your neighborhood or walk the perimeter of the grocery store a few times. Take the stairs instead of the elevator.</p>
<p>Find a partner. Exercise can be more interesting if you use the time to chat with a friend. Better yet, involve the whole family.</p>
<p>Try a class. Many fitness centers and hospitals offer classes, such as prenatal yoga, designed for pregnant women. Choose one that fits your interests and schedule.</p>
<p>Regular exercise can help you cope with the physical changes of pregnancy and build stamina for the challenges ahead. If you haven't been exercising regularly, use pregnancy as your motivation to begin.</p>
