You may not look pregnant yet but chances are you're feeling it. 
That's because a flood of pregnancy hormones is prepping your body to play baby 
hostess for the next nine months, so you could be in line for quite a few aches 
and pains, from fatigue to flatulence. <br>
During the first trimester alone your baby changes from a single fertilized cell 
(a zygote), to the embryo that implants itself in your uterine wall, to a
peach-sized bundle of growing limbs and body systems. Organs take shape, and baby 
starts to move.  
Here are a few of the big highlights happening in this exciting time:<br> 
Baby's bones: By about week 6, baby starts to sprout arms, legs, hands and feet,
and fingers and toes around week 10.
Hair and nails: Skin begins forming between weeks 5 and 8, with hair follicles 
and nail beds forming around week 8.
Digestive system: By about week 8, baby's intestines will begin forming, and
your baby will have already gone through two sets of kidneys (with the third and 
final set on its way!).
Sense of touch: Your baby will have touch receptors on his face (mostly lips and 
nose) around week 8. By week 12, he'll have receptors on his genitals, palms and 
the soles of his feet. <br>
Eyesight: Optic nerves (which pass info from the eyes to the brain and back) and 
lenses begin to form by week 4, with the retina beginning to form around week 8.
Heart: By week 5, the tube that will become your baby's heart begins to beat 
spontaneously. It will become stronger and more regular, and you'll be able to 
hear it! around week 9 or 10 (though sometimes later,
depending on your baby's position in your uterus).
Brain: By about week 8 of pregnancy, your baby's brain will be wiggling his 
developing limbs.
Sense of taste: Your baby will have developed taste buds that connect to his 
brain by about week 8 but he'll need taste pores before he can taste the 
surrounding amniotic fluid (which, by the way, 
tastes like your most recent meal). </p>

Welcome to your second trimester — for many women, the most comfortable of 
all three. With the arrival of this milestone, you'll experience some welcome 
changes. Most early pregnancy symptoms will ease up or even disappear. You’ll 
likely feel less queasy (which means food may finally smell and taste good for the
first time in a long while), your energy levels should be picking up, and your
breasts will still be bigger but feel a whole lot less tender. Most amazing of all:
By the end of this trimester, the bulge in your lower abdomen may be looking less
like the remains of a large lunch and more like the beginnings of a
pregnant belly. <br>
<b>BABY'S GROWTH IN THE SECOND TRIMESTER:</b>
Your baby is very, very busy in the second trimester. By week 18 of pregnancy, 
he weighs about as much as a chicken breast, he can yawn and hiccup, and he's got
finger prints on those tiny digits. By week 21 you should be able to feel his newly
coordinated arms and legs give you little jabs and kicks. By about week 23,
your baby takes a cue from you and starts to pack on the pounds; in fact, he'll 
likely double his weight in the next four weeks. By the end of your second 
trimester, you'll have a 2-pound human in your belly!<br></p>

It may feel as if there's no way your belly can get any bigger, but there's 
no doubt about it —  it will get bigger over the course of the third trimester 
of pregnancy. A lot bigger. Here's what to expect from your body and your 
rapidly-maturing baby in these final few weeks.<br>
<b>BABY'S GROWTH DURING THE THIRD TRIMESTER</b>
Your little one will get a whole lot larger in the third trimester, growing 
from about 2 1/2 pounds and 16 inches long in week 28 of pregnancy to between 6 and 9 pounds
and 19 to 22 inches long in week 40. Indeed, your baby is growing fast — so don't be 
surprised if his increase in size along with a decrease in 
living space leads to some serious kicks and pokes in your gut.
Here are a few of the highlights happening in your third trimester of pregnancy:
Bones: As your baby transforms cartilage to bone in months 7 and 8, he'll be getting all of 
her calcium from you — so be sure to eat plenty of calcium-rich foods.
Hair, skin and nails: By week 32 of pregnancy, baby's formerly see-through skin will become
opaque. In week 36, fat continues to accumulate as your baby sheds his vernix 
(the waxy substance that protects his skin from your amniotic fluid) and lanugo 
(the hairy coat that keeps him warm in there).
Digestive system: In the final weeks of pregnancy, meconium — or baby's first poop, 
consisting mostly of blood cells, vernix and lanugo — starts to build up in baby's 
intestines.
Five Senses: Your baby's touch receptors will be fully developed around week 29 or week 30.
By week 31 of pregnancy, your baby will get signals from all five senses, perceiving light 
and dark, tasting what you eat, and listening to the sound of your voice.
Brain: In the third trimester your baby's brain will grow faster than ever, test-driving
some nifty skills including blinking, dreaming and regulating his own body temperature. 
Around week 34 of pregnancy, baby's body turns southward, settling into a heads-down, 
bottom-up position — unless, of course, your baby remains stubbornly in the breech position
(in which case your doctor will likely attempt to manually turn baby around week 37)
