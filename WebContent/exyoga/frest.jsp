<h2 itemprop="headline">Relaxing - Final Resting Pose (Savasana)</h1>
<div class="col-lg-1"> 
<h3><strong>Benefits and Uses</strong></h3>
<p> Final resting pose (corpse pose) is the ultimate relaxation pose - lying flat on your back, with or without props, to ensure maximum comfort. This pose is generally taken at the end of a yoga class, as it provides a few moments to let all of the work done throughout the class settle into your body. After a challenging yoga practice, relaxation usually comes easily and will leave you feeling refreshed and ready to return to your day.  &nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Directions</strong><br></h3>

</div>
<p> Lie on your back on your mat with your arms at your sides and your palms facing up. If you have any tension in your lower back, roll up a blanket under your knees in order to give the natural curve of your lower spine some support on the floor. You may also want to place a blanket or low pillow under your head if you feel it needs to be slightly elevated. Relax. </p>
<p> Lay some soft music or nature sounds if this helps you to let go completely. Essential oils like lavender, placed on your temples and wrists can also be a wonderfully soothing touch.  </p>
<p> Make any adjustments that would feel good for your body. Stay here for at least five minutes of relaxation. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Breath</strong>: Let go of any breath control in this posture, just breath naturally and relax. </li><br>
<li><strong>Modifications</strong>:  Savasana is safe during trimesters one and two and before pregnancy. It is recommended that you not lie on your back for an extended period of time during the third trimester, in order to avoid uterine pressure on the vena cava vein (which carries blood back to the heart for oxygen from your legs and feet). Side sleeping is generally recommended in this trimester as a result. Try a side-lying relaxation position if this would feel more comfortable for you. You might also try propping up your torso and belly on an angle (using a bolster or stack of pillows behind your back) so that you minimize this pressure. Play around with what feels good and trust your instinct! &nbsp;</li><br>
<li><strong>Release</strong>: To come out of final relaxation pose from lying on your back, simply roll onto your right or left side into the fetal position. Stay here for a few moments as your prepare to ease yourself up to seated using your arm strength. Gently make your way up when you are ready, allowing your head to be the last part to rise and avoiding straining your neck in this process. If you were lying on your side already, repeat the latter part of the release instructions, gently returning to a comfortable seated position. </li><br>
