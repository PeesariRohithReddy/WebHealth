<h3><strong>Benefits and Uses</strong></h3>
<p> Dancing is great exercise during pregnancy! Not only do you get to move your body to music you love, but it will keep you flexible while toning your muscles. You can get a cardiovascular workout from any fast-paced dance, or stretch and maintain muscle tone when you hold positions in ballet. &nbsp;</p>
<p> Before doing any kind of pregnancy exercise, be sure to get clearance from your healthcare provider. If you danced regularly before getting pregnant, you can probably continue dancing at the same intensity as before, but you'll need to make modifications as your belly expands.</p>
<p> If your provider gives you the green light, you can use dance as your workout routine as often as you want. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises at least 20 to 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most or all days of the week.

<h3><strong>General tips for dancing in first trimester</strong></h3>
<p> Dance as you normally would, but keep a few precautions in mind: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warm up first.</strong>  Warming up prepares your joints and muscles for exercise, which also builds up your heart rate slowly. Skipping a warm-up could strain ligaments and joints, leading to injury. The most effective way to warm up is by dancing at low intensity and gradually building it up over 5 to 8 minutes to your workout level.</li>
<li><strong>Listen to your body.</strong>  Adjust the intensity of your dancing according to how you feel. Slow down if you can't carry on a conversation comfortably, and take a break if you can't catch your breath.</li>
<li><strong>Be gentle. </strong>  Keep your workout easy on your joints by keeping one foot on the floor at all times. If your joints get sore from doing certain moves, try substituting others, such as marching or stepping side to side.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always be aware of your body's limitations and pay attention to signs that you're doing too much. These include severe muscle weakness and soreness after a workout, or feeling exhausted instead of invigorated afterward.</p>

<h3><strong>General tips for dancing in second trimester</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> You may find that the sharp, jarring movements of styles such as Zumba, hip hop, and tap become more difficult as you grow, but otherwise you can continue for as long as you're comfortable.</li>
<li> Ballroom dancing is a great way to get your heart rate up and activate your muscles, though you and your partner will need to make modifications as your belly expands.</li>
<li> Belly dancing keeps you flexible, and the gentle movements make it a good choice for pregnancy.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>General tips for walking in third trimester</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> Your center of gravity shifts as your belly gets bigger. Keep your balance by avoiding moves that make you feel unstable, and slow down if you find yourself wobbling between steps.</li>
<li> Shorten the range of motion of your movements (such as shortening your bends or not stepping as wide).</li>
<li> If you feel pain during dance workouts, keep track of how long you can exercise before the joint or muscle discomfort begins and don't dance that long.</li>
<li> If you join a group dance class, always make sure you have at least a leg's length of room between you and others. Otherwise, someone might accidentally kick or push you during routines.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Signs indicating you to slow down</strong></h3>
<p> "The key for keeping dance safe during pregnancy is to keep in mind that your body may respond differently each day you exercise," says Catherine Cram, MS, an exercise physiologist who specializes in maternal fitness. What works for you one day may not feel as comfortable the next, so adjust your routine as often as needed. &nbsp;</p>
<p> Also, make sure the shoes you're wearing fit the sport. Running shoes aren't a good choice for dancing because they tend to be heavy, and the wider soles can cause tripping with dance moves. Invest in a pair of shoes that are designed for dance movement, and measure your foot to make sure you're wearing the correct size. (Your <strong>feet can become larger during pregnancy.</strong>)</p>
