<h3><strong>Benefits and Uses</strong></h3>
<p> Prenatal yoga classes are very popular, and when paired with a cardiovascular exercise (such as walking), yoga can be an ideal way for moms-to-be to stay in shape. Whether you're a newbie or a veteran, yoga can keep you limber, tone your muscles, and improve your balance and circulation during pregnancy - all with very little impact on your joints. &nbsp;</p>
<p> Yoga is also beneficial because you'll learn how to breathe deeply and consciously relax, which will be helpful as you face the physical demands of labor, birth, and new motherhood. Learning to breathe fully is actually one of the first things you'll learn in a yoga class. To use the breathing technique practiced in yoga, known as ujjayi, you take in air slowly through your nose, fill your lungs as you expand your belly, and exhale completely until your stomach compresses.</p>
<p> Learning to do ujjayi breathing primes you for labor and childbirth by training you to stay calm when you need it most. When you're in pain or afraid, your body produces adrenalin and may produce less oxytocin, a hormone that makes labor progress. A regular yoga practice will help you resist the urge to tighten up when you feel pain, and make it easier to relax instead.</p>
<p> The benefits of yoga aren't limited to your pregnancy and physical well-being. "Taking a prenatal yoga class is a great way to meet other pregnant women and to become part of a community," says Cynthea Denise, a registered nurse and prenatal yoga instructor in Oakland, California. Being in a positive, supportive environment with others can give you a regular emotional boost and keep you motivated to continue exercising.</p>

<h3><strong>General tips for yoga in first trimester</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> First, check with your provider to make sure it's okay for you to start or continue a yoga program. If you get the go-ahead, try to find an instructor trained in prenatal yoga. If that's not possible, make sure your instructor knows you're expecting</li>
<li> Breathe deeply and regularly as you stretch. If you're already a pro at yoga, recognize and accept that your regular routine will require modifications as time goes on.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>General tips for yoga in second trimester</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> Your joints are beginning to loosen up now, so sink into yoga positions slowly and carefully.</li>
<li> Hold poses only for as long as you're comfortable.</li>
<li> Use a wedge or pillows to raise your upper body when you're lying down.</li>
<li> Be aware that your slowly expanding girth will affect your sense of balance.</li>

<h3><strong>General tips for yoga in third trimester</strong></h3>
<p> You're probably feeling less graceful now that your belly is bigger, so keep these tips in mind as you continue your yoga practice:</p>
<ul>
<li> Do all standing poses with your heel to the wall, or use a chair for support to avoid losing your balance and risking injury to yourself or your baby.</li>
<li> Use props such as blocks and straps to help you move through different poses with greater stability.</li>
<li> Don't hold poses for a long time: It's important to keep moving because standing still for too long slows the rate of blood flow back to the heart in some pregnant women.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Safety Precautions</strong></h3>
<p> Never run to the point of exhaustion or breathlessness. Pushing yourself to the limit forces your body to divert oxygen that should be going to your baby. Ease up if you notice any of the following signs: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid lying on your back</strong>, especially after the first trimester. Lying on your back can put pressure on your inferior vena cava (the vein that returns blood from the legs to the heart) and reduce blood flow to your uterus. It can also make you feel dizzy and cause shortness of breath and nausea.
Use a wedge or pillows to raise your upper body when you're lying down. Or limit the time you're flat on your back to one minute, and roll over onto your side for 30 seconds between each exercise on your back.</li>
<li><strong>Skip headstands and shoulder stands</strong> "Pregnancy is not the time to start an inversion practice," says Denise. The risk of falling or feeling faint from having your head below your heart makes these poses unsafe for most pregnant women.</li>
<li><strong>Skip positions that require extreme stretching of the abdominal muscles.</strong> Deep forward and back bends as well as deep twists can lead to injury. Avoid stretching moves that feel uncomfortable or cause muscle soreness.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid doing yoga in hot, humid conditions.</strong> Don't take Bikram or hot yoga classes (in which the room is heated to 90 degrees or higher) because this could cause dangerous overheating.</li>
</ul>
