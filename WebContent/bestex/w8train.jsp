<h3><strong>Benefits and Uses</strong></h3>
<p> Strengthening your abdominal and back muscles can help prevent the lower back pain that's common during pregnancy. Weight training helps you build stamina, which you need during labor and delivery. Strength training throughout pregnancy can also help you keep your weight gain within a healthy range for your body. &nbsp;</p>
<p> According to a few small studies, weight training may help women with gestational diabetes manage their condition: One study suggested that resistance training can reduce the need for insulin therapy, and another found that it reduced the risk of macrosomia.</p>

<h3><strong>General tips for weight training</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check with your provider first.</strong> Check in with your doctor or midwife to make sure it's okay for you to start lifting weights or continue doing your regular workout. Then consult a fitness professional with training in prenatal exercise to see if you should make any changes because you're pregnant. Even if you've been lifting weights for a while, ask the trainer to review your technique - changes in your body shape may affect your lifting form.</li>
<li><strong>Use proper lifting technique.</strong> Avoid weights that are too heavy to lift correctly, and don't rush: Count to three as you lift, and count to three again as you return to start position. If you feel any discomfort or instability in your joints, modify your movements or stop the exercise. </li>
<li><strong>Avoid weight training while lying flat on your back. </strong> When you lie on your back, the weight of your uterus presses on the major vein that returns blood back to the heart, leading to low blood pressure and potentially interfering with the flow of blood and nutrients to your baby. Starting in the second trimester, tilt the weight bench or use pillows to prop you up so that you're lying at more of an angle. Or just do other types of strength-training exercises that don't require you to lie flat.</li>
<li><strong>Use proper breathing technique. </strong> Exhale as you exert during the lift, and inhale as you return to start position. Avoid holding your breath and bearing down (as if straining during a bowel movement) because this can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure and reduce oxygen flow to your baby, not to mention make you feel lightheaded and dizzy.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust your strength-training routine as needed. </strong> Aim for moderate intensity - a workout level that you would describe as "somewhat hard." If you were lifting weights before you became pregnant, you should be able to continue your training routine as before, but listen to your body and reduce the amount of weight and number of repetitions if you feel pain or excess muscle fatigue.
If you're new to strength training, one set of 10 to 12 repetitions should be enough. You can gradually increase the amount of weight when it feels comfortable.
As your belly grows, it may become difficult (if not impossible) to do certain exercises, and you may need to adjust your positioning to maintain proper lifting technique. Ask your caregiver or a prenatal fitness professional how to use towels or pillows for extra support.</li>
<li><strong>Rest between strength workouts.</strong> Give yourself 48 hours of rest between strength-training sessions. Aim for three sessions per week.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Equipment needed</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> two dumbbells weighing 3 to 8 pounds each</li>
<li> sturdy chair</li>
<li> resistance band</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Shoulder lateral raises</strong></h3>
<p> Sit up straight on the edge of a sturdy chair with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, about hip-width apart. With your hands by your hips, palms facing in, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Slightly bend your elbows, then lift your arms up to the side - no higher than shoulder height - leading the motion with your elbows. Keeping your shoulder blades pulled down toward your hips, lower your arms. Do 10 to 12 reps.</p>
<p> <strong>Tip:</strong> Try not to elevate your shoulders. If you need more support, sit up tall with your chest lifted and your spine resting on the back of the chair.</p>

<h3><strong>Seated row</strong></h3>
<p> Sit up straight on the floor with shoulders down and chest lifted. Extend your legs in front of you, with your knees slightly bent. (If your hamstrings are tight, sit on a rolled-up towel or blanket to elevate your trunk slightly and release tension in the lower back.)</p>
<p> Wrap the resistance band around the balls of your feet and hold the ends of the band in your hands. Extend your arms in front of your body, hands level with shoulders, palms facing the floor and elbows slightly bent.</p>
<p> Exhale and draw your shoulder blades down and together, contracting the middle of your upper back. Keep these muscles engaged and continue to bend your elbows slightly behind your shoulder joint, drawing your arms toward your body as if rowing a boat. Keep your arms level with your shoulders. Slowly and with control, return your arms to extend in front. Do 10 to 12 reps.</p>
<p> <strong>Tip:</strong> Don't lean forward. If you need to increase resistance, shorten the band by wrapping the ends around your hands or moving your grip closer to the center of the band. To lower resistance, move your hands closer to the ends of the band. Each repetition should be slow and controlled, working through a full range of motion. You can also try the seated row while sitting on an exercise ball.</p>

<h3><strong>Squat</strong></h3>
<p> Stand facing the back of a chair with your feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart, shoulder blades pulled down, and abdominal muscles contracted. Turn your legs out at the hips, with both feet pointing out and knees positioned directly over your toes. Inhale and bend at the knees, keeping your posture straight. Hold. Exhale and return to standing position. Do 10 to 12 reps.</p>
<p> <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep your weight toward your heels.</p>
