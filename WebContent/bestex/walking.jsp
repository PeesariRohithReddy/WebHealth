<h3><strong>Benefits and Uses</strong></h3>
<p> Walking is one of the best cardiovascular exercises for pregnant women - especially because it keeps you fit without requiring special equipment or extra cost. It's also a safe activity to continue throughout all nine months of pregnancy and one of the easier ways to start exercising if you haven't previously been active. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>General tips for walking</strong></h3>
<p> If you've been walking for exercise, keep it up. If you were fairly inactive before you got pregnant, start with a slow walk and gradually build up to brisk jaunts of 20 to 60 minutes. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, you can safely do moderate exercise for 20 to 30 minutes on most or all days of the week, as long as your healthcare provider has given you the go-ahead. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These basic precautions can keep you comfortable and healthy on your walks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wear good shoes.</strong> Make sure you have walking shoes that fit. Pregnancy can increase your foot size, so have your foot measured to make sure you're wearing the correct size. If you notice your feet getting larger, it's a good idea to buy a new pair of exercise shoes and insert a gel liner for better shock absorption.</li>
<li><strong>Protect your skin.</strong> Wear sunblock, no matter what the season. Sun exposure can worsen melasma, a condition in which blotchy areas of darkened skin appear during pregnancy. 
Minimize this by using a broad spectrum sunblock with an SPF of 30 or higher every morning before you leave the house. Reapply frequently when outdoors.</li>
<li><strong>Stay hydrated. </strong> Bring drinking water with you to prevent dehydration, which can cause contractions and raise your body temperature - sometimes to levels that are dangerous for you and your baby.
Tip: Fill your water bottle one-quarter full and freeze it. Add water to the bottle just before you exercise, and your drink will stay cold for your entire workout.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel up.</strong> Have a high-protein snack 30 minutes before you exercise. Cheese, yogurt, or peanut butter on half a bagel are healthy choices.</li>
<li><strong>Stay cool. </strong> If it's very hot and humid outside (or cold in winter), go for a walk in a climate-controlled mall or on a treadmill at home or at the gym. If you decide to walk in warm weather, go early in the morning or late in the day to avoid peak temperatures. Wear a sun hat and carry a spray bottle filled with water for cooling off.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>General tips for walking in second trimester</strong></h3>
<p> Wear supportive shoes, continue to wear sun protection, and avoid dehydration. You may be more ungainly now, so pay attention to your posture to avoid straining your back: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain good form.</strong>  When you walk, keep your head up and shoulders back. If your back feels sore while you're walking, try a belly support band.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize swelling.</strong> If your hands are swollen, wear a light backpack so you can hold onto the straps to reduce the swelling. You may want to grab higher up on the straps to help your upper body stay upright and minimize the swayback posture that's common later in pregnancy.</li>
<li><strong>Keep moving. </strong>  Swing your arms for balance and to intensify your workout.</li>
<li><strong>Stay safe.</strong> Don't walk outside after dark unless the area is brightly lit - you're at increased risk of stumbling and falling if you can't see where you're going.</li>
<li><strong>Be social. </strong> You may want to find a buddy to join you on your walks and keep you motivated, or start a walking group.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>General tips for walking in third trimester</strong></h3>
<p> Keep up your walking regimen as long as you can, but avoid hiking trails or uneven terrain that could put you off balance. As you get closer to your due date, consider walking on a track. Not only is the surface easier on your body, you might feel safer knowing that you won't get stuck far from home or your car in case of an emergency. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support your belly.</strong> If your lower back is sore or your round ligaments feel painful, try wearing a belly support band during your walks.</li>
<li><strong>Break it up.</strong> If your usual walking distance is tougher to manage near the end of your pregnancy, try breaking it up into two shorter walks so you don't get as tired.</li>
<li><strong>Stay connected. </strong> Carry your cell phone and emergency contact information in case of a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Keep others informed.</strong> Always let someone know your walking route and when you plan to return from your walk.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Signs indicating you to slow down</strong></h3>
<p> Your body will let you know if you're pushing yourself too hard. It's important to adjust your routine if you notice signs of overtraining because exercising to the point that your body is too fatigued to fully repair itself between workouts can make you more vulnerable to injury and illness. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li> Never walk to the point of exhaustion or breathlessness. Listen to your body and slow down and rest or stop if you feel exhausted or can't catch your breath.</li>
<li> If you develop muscle or joint pain that doesn't go away within 24 hours, take a break for a few days and try walking again at a slower pace and for a shorter period of time. If you're still having pain, stop walking and try a non-weight-bearing exercise such as swimming.</li>
</ul>
