<h3><strong>Benefits and Uses</strong></h3>
<p> Any type of aerobic exercise during pregnancy can benefit you - and your baby - by strengthening your heart and making it more efficient at pumping blood. This improves circulation to your whole body and boosts oxygen levels in your blood. Swimming gives you all this and more! As one of the safest forms of exercise for expectant moms, here are some of the benefits of swimming: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li> It works both of your large muscle groups (arms and legs).</li>
<li> It's low impact and gentle on your body. The water keeps you from overheating and prevents injury by supporting your joints and ligaments as you exercise, which is especially helpful for moms-to-be with round ligament pain. The buoyancy of the water lets you enjoy a feeling of weightlessness despite the extra pounds of pregnancy.</li>
<li> It counteracts increased back strain from your expanding belly. Pregnancy can make your spine and shoulders round forward and tilt your pelvis out of alignment, but swimming gently strengthens the muscles and offsets this tendency.</li>
<li> It can help you keep your weight within a healthy range.</li>
<li> Immersing yourself in water alleviates swelling in your arms and legs.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>General tips for swimming</strong></h3>
<p> Try to swim for 20 to 30 minutes on most, if not all, days of the week. If you swam regularly before pregnancy, you should be able to continue without much modification. Just be sure you know the warning signs to slow down or stop exercising. &nbsp;</p>
<p> If you didn't exercise at all before pregnancy, it's probably fine for you to swim, but check with your doctor or midwife first. If it's okay, start slowly, stretch well to warm up and cool down, and be careful not to overexert yourself.</p>
<p> When you're in the water, it can be easy to forget to stay hydrated. A good guideline is to aim to drink one 8-ounce glass before you start your swim, one glass for every 20 minutes of exercise, and one glass after you get out of the pool. In hot or humid weather, you need more.</p>

<h3><strong>General tips for swimming in first trimester</strong></h3>
<p> If you have the energy, swimming first thing in the morning may prevent nausea and energize you for the rest of the day. Use a kickboard, noodle, or another type of pool equipment to vary your workout and keep it fun.</p>
<p> If the smell of chlorine triggers nausea or causes skin or eye discomfort, see if there's a saltwater pool in your area. If you want to swim in a body of water like an ocean, lake, or pond, check your healthcare provider first because germs and bacteria in open water can cause illness.</p>

<h3><strong>General tips for swimming in second trimester</strong></h3>
<p> As your pregnancy progresses and you grow larger, you won't need to cut down on swimming very much because it's such a gentle activity for expectant moms. &nbsp;</p>
<p> The water's buoyancy also reduces the effects of gravity on your body, so you can lie on your back to do the backstroke without risking the impaired blood flow such positions can cause on dry land.</p>

<h3><strong>General tips for swimming in third trimester</strong></h3>
<p> Comfort is key during the last weeks of pregnancy, so try different strokes to see which ones feel most comfortable. You may also want to get a maternity swimsuit to accommodate your expanding belly. You can use a snorkel to relieve the pressure on your neck when you bob up and down for air. &nbsp;</p>
<p> If you have sore or tight muscles, try walking in the shallow end of the pool instead of swimming. Move your arms through the water as you walk for more resistance. If you feel tired, use a paddle board to support your upper body, and take breaks as needed.</p>
<p> Be extra careful when getting out of the pool, and wear nonslip footwear for walking on wet surfaces.</p>
<p>If you're looking for an alternative to a traditional table massage, try Watsu - a type of bodywork done in a warm pool. In Watsu, the massage therapist holds your body in chest-deep water and gently massages and stretches your body. This type of massage is well-suited to pregnant women whose expanding bellies make it hard to lie comfortably on a massage table.</p>
