<p>If <em>weight </em>and <em>gain</em> have always been unspeakable words to you, added pounds are about to be a plus: You're pregnant, and that means you're<em> supposed </em>to gain weight. That said, it's important to know how much to gain and when to gain it.</p>
<p>Pack on way too many pounds and you increase your chances of gestational diabetes, hypertension and complications during labor and delivery (not to mention you'll more likely find yourself with stretch marks plus extra pounds to shed once you've delivered). In fact,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6443a3.htm?s_cid=mm6443a3_w">a government report from November 2015</a>&nbsp;found that 47 percent of American moms gained more than the recommended amount of weight during pregnancy, putting themselves and their babies at risk for health problems both during and after pregnancy.</p>
<p>Pack on too few, as about one in five moms do, and you're at an increased risk for a baby who's born too soon or too small (or both) along with other pregnancy complications. Bottom line: A steady pace is best for you, your body, your pregnancy and, most of all, your baby.</p>
<p>While all of this may sound overwhelming, in most cases there's a lot you can do to keep your weight gain under control (plus, of course, your doctor will be there to guide you). Here's some important info to keep in mind to gain a healthy amount of weight during pregnancy.</p>

<h2 id="bmi">Understanding Your BMI</h2>
<p>You may have heard the often-repeated 25 to 35 pounds as the suggested weight gain goal range for women during their pregnancy, but that's directed at women whose Body Mass Index, or BMI, falls into the "normal weight" category. Your BMI is calculated by your height and weight. The first step to determining your weight gain goal is to <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm">determine your BMI</a>.</p>
<h2 id="weightgain">How Much Weight to Gain and When</h2>
<p>Unlike the equation used to calculate your BMI, the process of putting on pounds is not an exact science. Your rate of weight gain will depend on a variety of factors, such as your metabolism, your activity level and your genetics - just another reason why it's important to keep up your doctor appointments throughout your pregnancy. That said, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) offers general weight gain guidelines based on various BMI ranges (see chart below). These vary by trimester:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>During your first trimester</strong>, your baby is still tiny, which means you don't need to gain more than a total of three to four pounds. However if you're suffering from morning sickness, you might not gain an ounce (or might even lose a little). That's OK, as long as your appetite picks up and you make up for those pounds in the second trimester.</li>
<li><strong>In your second trimester</strong>, your baby starts to grow in earnest. Your weight gain should pick up so that, if you started out pregnancy at a normal weight, you'd gain a total of about 14 pounds.</li>
<li><strong>In your third trimester, </strong> baby's weight gain will pick up steam, but yours may start to taper off for a net gain of about 10 pounds. Some women find their weight holds steady or even drops a pound or two during the ninth month, when ever-tighter abdominal quarters can make finding room for food a struggle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gradual weight gain is as important as the number of pounds you gain, since your baby needs a steady supply of nutrients and calories to grow during his or her stay in the womb. The amount of weight you should gain each week in trimesters two and three differs depending on your BMI:</p>

<p>If you're carrying twins (and eating for three), the weight gain recommendations for women of an average weight is 37 to 54 pounds. Overweight women should gain 31 to 50 pounds, and obese women should gain 25 to 42 pounds.</p>
<p>How closely will you be able to follow this formula? Realistically, not that closely. There will be weeks when your self-control will waver and it'll be a rocky road (by the half gallon) to your weight gain total. And there will be weeks when eating will seem too much of an effort. Try not to stress over the scale. As long as your overall gain is on target and your rate averages out to the above, you're right on track.</p>
<h2 id="weightgoing">Where's the Weight Going?</h2>
<p>Ever wonder how your pregnancy weight is distributed in your body? It may feel like it's all in your belly, but that's not actually the case. For a 30-pound weight gain, here's the average breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baby:</strong> 7.5 pounds</li>
<li><strong>Placenta:</strong> 1.5 pounds</li>
<li><strong>Amniotic fluid:</strong> 2 pounds</li>
<li><strong>Uterine enlargement:</strong> 2 pounds</li>
<li><strong>Maternal breast tissue:</strong> 2 pounds</li>
<li><strong>Maternal blood volume:</strong> 4 pounds</li>
<li><strong>Fluids in maternal tissue:</strong> 4 pounds</li>
<li><strong>Maternal fat stores: </strong> 7 pounds</li>
</ul>
<p>You need weight in all these areas in order to have a healthy baby and to get your body ready for motherhood (including preparing your body for nursing).</p>
<h2 id="weighingyourself">Weighing Yourself</h2>
<p>For best weight gain results, keep your eye on the scale, since what you don't know can throw your weight way off-target. Weigh yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the same time of day</li>
<li>Wearing the same amount of clothes (or none at all)</li>
<li>On the same scale</li>
<li>Once a week (more often and you'll drive yourself crazy with day-to-day fluid fluctuations; if your scale-phobic, twice a month should do the trick)</li>
</ul>
<p>Waiting until your monthly prenatal checkup to check your weight is fine, too - though keep in mind that a lot can happen in a month (as in 10 pounds) or not happen (as in no pounds), making it harder for you to stay on track.</p>
<h2 id="caloriestoeat">How Many Calories Should You Eat?</h2>
<p>The key to healthy pregnancy weight gain is eating a well-balanced pregnancy diet. That means some not-so-fun news: The expression "eating for two" is a myth - or at least an exaggeration. (Sorry!) Instead of doubling your caloric intake, you likely won't need any more calories in the first trimester. In the second trimester you should add about an additional 300 calories per day, and in the final trimester of your pregnancy you'll need close to 500 calories more per day than you were eating before you conceived. As a rule, instead of just eating <em>more</em>, focus on eating nutrient-rich foods that will give you energy</a>, help keep morning sickness at bay and fuel all of the incredible fetal development going on inside of you, from fetal bone growth to the formation of your baby's skin, eyes and digestive system.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that if you have a fast metabolism are very physically active or are carrying multiples, you may gain weight more slowly and will need to eat more calories. And if you were overweight or obese before you got pregnant, you may not need as many calories. As always, it's important to check with your practitioner to get a personalized recommendation on your caloric and weight gain goals.</p>
<h2 id="redflags">Weight Gain Red Flags</h2>
<p>If you gain more than three pounds in any one week in the second trimester, or if you gain more than two pounds in any week in the third trimester - especially if it doesn't seem to be related to overeating or excessive intake of sodium - check with your practitioner, as it could be a symptom of preeclampsia - also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) or toxemia - is a disorder that generally develops late in pregnancy (after week 20) and is characterized by a sudden onset of high blood pressure, severe swelling of the hands and face and signs that some organs may not be working normally (including protein in the urine).  Check, too, if you gain no weight for more than two weeks in a row during the fourth to eighth months.</p>
<h2 id="weightcomeoff">Will All That Weight Ever Come Off?</h2>
<p>Many women fear that they won't be able to lose the weight they gain during pregnancy once baby is born, but there's no need to stress about it. There are lots of healthy ways to lose weight after pregnancy - and many of them are also great ways to meet other new moms (like stroller walking groups or baby-and-me yoga classes). Many gyms offer childcare for babies as young as 3 months old, which is a great way for you to boost endorphins and get a break from your little one - both of which can help keep the baby blues at bay. On top of that, many women are shocked at how quickly they are able to lose the pounds by breastfeeding alone (women who breastfeed for even a few months tend to lose weight faster than those moms who don't at all). Just remember, gaining the right amount of weight (and not too much) during pregnancy makes it a whole lot easier to shed the pounds once baby arrives.</p>
