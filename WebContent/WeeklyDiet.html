<h1>Your Guide to the Dietary and Nutrient Intake</h1>
              <hr style="color:green;border:3px solid green;">
              <p style="color:#8e7bb8;font-style: italic;font-size:120%;">Getting the right nutrition while you're expecting is one of the best ways to give your baby a head start in life. It can help make pregnancy safer and more comfortable for you, too. So check out our pregnancy diet recommendations and get to know about all the good stuff you need when you're eating for two. Also, enjoy the recipes for some delicious meals and treats that you can eat anywhere - whether you're at home or work or just enjoying your time out.<p>
			  <p style="font-size:120%;">For baby: Helps improve the odds baby is born at a healthy weight, boosts brain development, descreases risk for certain birth defects (including neural tube defects like spina bifida) and, as a bonus, could result in better eating habits after birth as your baby grows to be a potentially picky eater.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">For you: Decreases the odds you'll experience some pregnancy complications (anemia, gestational diabetes and preeclampsia are less prevalent among women who eat well), makes your pregnancy more comfortable (a sensible diet can minimize morning sickness, fatigue, constipation and a host of other pregnancy symptoms), balance your emotions (good nutrition can help moderate mood swings), improve your odds of a timely labor and delivery (you're less likely to go into preterm labor) and a speedier postpartum recovery (a well-nourished body bounces back faster and has less pounds to shed after delivery).</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;"> Luckily scoring these benefits is relatively simple. The foundation of a healthy pregnancy diet is the same as the average healthy diet: a balanced mix of lean protein and calcium, whole grains, a rainbow of fruits and vegetables and healthy fats (with usually a little more calories and nutrients to nourish baby). By following a few guidelines dedicated to baby's wellbeing and yours, you'll experience some impressive benefits:</p>

<h2>Dietary guidelines for week: 0 to 8</h2>
              <hr style="color:green;border:3px solid green;">              
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <img alt="first trimester" src="resources/Images/fruitsnvegs.jpg">
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <br>
              <p style="font-size:120%;font-style: oblique;">Congratulations!!...now that you're a mom-to-be, its the perfect time to eat healthy. Of course, this is difficult if you have morning sickness and you do not feel like eating anything at all.
When your stomach feels more settled, try to eat nutritious, well-balanced meals. If you know you haven't been eating as well as you could, pregnancy is a good time to establish healthy eating habits. This will make sure you get all the nutrients you and your baby need. </p>
<h3>Conception helpful foods</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;"> You need folic acid during pregnancy to help protect your unborn baby against developing neural tube defects, such as spina bifida. Health Canada recommends that you take a daily multivitamin containing 400 mcg (0.4 mg) of folic acid while you are pregnant. In fact, Health Canada says that any woman who could get pregnant should take the same amount of folic acid. If you are planning a pregnancy, the official advice is to start taking folic acid three months before getting pregnant. </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;"> Start taking a multi-vitamin containing folic acid as soon as you can. And try some of these foods which are loaded with folate viz: Legumes including lentils and romano beans, black beans, white beans, pinto beans, kidney beans and chickpeas. Vegetables including cooked asparagus and spinach, salad greens like Romaine lettuce, mustard greens and endive, avocado, Brussels sprouts, cooked beets and broccoli, raw spinach, parsley, parsnips, corn and green peas, raw broccoli and cauliflower, baby carrots, and seaweed. Seeds and nuts like shelled sunflower seeds, peanuts, walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts. Fruits and berries such as raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, kiwis, clementines.</p> 
<p style="font-size:120%;"> Dairy is a definite do when you're trying to conceive - it's chock-full of calcium, which is great for bone and reproductive health. And downing one serving of full-fat dairy a day, like whole milk (or even full-fat ice cream, yum!), can help you overcome ovulation issues and get pregnant. You can also find fertility-friendly calcium in leafy greens, tofu, and fortified juices.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;"> While refined carbs (aka white bread, white rice, and sugary snacks) cause your blood sugar to spike, they can mess with your reproductive hormones and menstrual cycle - whole grains keep it stable and may even promote regular ovulation. Fatty varieties such as salmon, sardines, and herring are actually fertility-boosting foods. They're full of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help regulate reproductive hormones, increase blood flow to reproductive organs, and even minimize stress.</p>

<h3>Caffeine Intake</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Caffeine has impressive pick-me-up powers - but it's also a diuretic that washes calcium and other key pregnancy nutrients out of your system before they can be thoroughly absorbed. Another downside to this diuretic effect: frequent urination, which is the last thing a pregnant woman needs (you'll be peeing plenty on your own now that you're pregnant). What's more motivation for cutting down on caffeine during pregnancy is that caffeine's stimulating effects may make those already delightful mood swings even more volatile and intense. The latest information from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists indicates that two cups of coffee a day (about 200mg per day) is okay, but heavier caffeine intake (in the range of five to six cups of coffee per day) slightly increases your risk of miscarriage.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Eating smaller, more frequent meals and snacks will keep your energy up by keeping your blood sugar from dipping. Prenatal vitamins will also help you maintain your stamina without a caffeine fix.</p> 

<h3>Morning Sickness</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Morning sickness is more common and tends to be more severe in first pregnancies, which supports the idea that both physical and emotional factors may be involved. Physically the novice pregnant body is less prepared for the onslaught of hormones and other changes it's experiencing than one that's been there, done that. Emotionally, first timers are more likely to be subject to the kinds of anxieties and fears that can turn a stomach - while women in subsequent pregnancies may be distracted from their nausea by the demands of caring for older children.  </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">It could be triggered by the increased level of the pregnancy hormone hCG (which peaks around the time morning sickness is worst). Rising levels of estrogen and progesterone levels relax the muscles of the digestive tract, making digestion less efficient. </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Morning sickness doesn't wait for you to get up in the morning. In fact, nausea is most likely to strike when you're running on empty, as you are after a long night's sleep. That's because when you haven't eaten in a while, the acids churning around inside your empty tummy have nothing to digest but your stomach lining - which, not surprisingly, increases queasiness. To head off heaving, stock your nightstand full of trail mix, crackers, and cold cereal to munch on first thing in the morning.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Making sure you get your eight glasses of fluid a day is especially crucial if vomiting is leaving you high, dry, and dehydrated. Can't stand water? Try sucking on Popsicles. Some women find that drinking and eating at the same sitting puts too much strain on their digestive tract; if this is true for you, try taking fluids between meals. If you're finding liquids are easier to get down when you're green, drink your vitamins and nutrients with soups, smoothies and shakes.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Many women find the smell and taste of lemons comforting. Sour sucking candies or a sniff of freshly-cut lemon may be your ticket to relief. Ginger can be good for what ails a queasy pregnant woman. It's been shown in more than one scientific study to reduce nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. So stock up on staples such as ginger snaps, real ginger ale, ginger tea, ginger candies, ginger biscuits, crystallized ginger or ginger drinks.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Take your prenatal vitamin to compensate for nutrients you may not be getting, at whatever time of day you're least likely to cuck it back up. Make sure it's iron-free, at least until the morning sickness during pregnancy passes. </p>

<h3>Food Cravings</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Some expectant moms love sweets and some love salt , but sometimes there is such a thing as loving too much. Luckily, for every sweet or salty junk food on the menu, there's a healthier choice that (coupled with a little, or sometimes a lot, of willpower) can keep your taste buds — and your baby — happy. Eat soy chips or baked potato or taco chips for greasy varieties. Or munch your way through some air-popped popcorn, rice cakes, pretzels, or lightly salted edamame. Have a cup of hot chocolate (that you've made with skim milk) or a single-serving Fudgsicle instead of that king-sized Snickers. Instead of ice creams, try frozen yogurt and top it with fresh berries to score nutritional brownie points.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">If your cravings are sending you spoon first into a bowl of sugar-frosted cereal, look to satisfy your sweet tooth a healthier way. Eat a low-sugar whole-grain cereal (like Cheerios) topped with fresh strawberries and bananas, and maybe a drizzle of honey. For chips cravings, baking up some potato chips (red-skinned potatoes, drizzled with olive oil, sprinkled with a little salt and some parmesan cheese, and baked until crisp) or diving into a bag of soy crisps (they're crispy and tasty like the potato chips, but packed with protein you and your baby need). </p>

<h2>Dietary guidelines for week: 9 to 12</h2>
              <hr style="color:green;border:3px solid green;">              
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <img alt="first trimester" src="resources/Images/diet9to12.jpg">
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <br>
              <p style="font-size:120%;font-style: oblique;" >During these weeks, your baby's entire bone structure will be completed and good nutrition will help support this development.
<p style="font-size:120%;">To fuel the baby-making factory that's in operation 24/7, you're producing more blood, your heart rate is up, your metabolism is burning energy overtime (even when you're lying down), and you're using up more nutrients and water. What's more, your body's still in the process of manufacturing your baby's placenta (which won't be complete until the fourth month). It's not surprising that you're always fighting fatigue - and feeling like you're fighting a losing battle. Even if you're already packing an alphabet's worth of vitamins and minerals into your daily meals, you might still worry that you're not taking in enough of the nutritional right stuff - especially if your appetite hasn't quite gotten up to speed just yet. Enter these "nutritional superstars" - pregnancy power foods that pack plenty of nutrients into just a few bites, making them especially effective.</p>

<h3>Magnesium intake</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Magnesium is important for your growing baby, as it is necessary for proper bone growth. A recent study found that the amount of magnesium eaten in the first trimester was related to the weight, length and head circumference of babies at birth, so this is another reason to make sure that you eat magnesium-rich foods like seeds from pumpkins, squash and sunflowers.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Magnesium is essential for all muscle health, including your uterus. It helps to make and repair tissue, also. Luckily, it is plentiful in salad greens, nuts, soy beans, seeds (particularly pumpkin, melon and sunflower) and whole grains. Aim to include these magnesium-rich foods in your diet. The placenta helps to regulate magnesium levels, so don't worry about taking in more than you need, and a fall in magnesium levels in late pregnancy is thought to help bring on labour.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Nuts are chock-full of important minerals (copper, manganese, magnesium, selenium, zinc, potassium, and even calcium) and vitamin E, plus they're easily portable, making them a filling on-the-go snack. Even though they're high in fat, it's mainly the good-for-you kind.</p>

<h3>Vitamins</h3> 
<p style="font-size:120%;">Vitamin A is needed throughout your baby's development, particularly to ensure the health of skin and that of the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. In the first three months, your baby lays down his own store of vitamin A, so you need to ensure a good supply. Sweet potato, carrots, squash, spinach and mangoes are all sources. It also helps to keep your skin and the linings of your internal organs healthy. Eat plenty of reduced-fat dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese, for their retinol (animal-derived vitamin A) content, remembering not to use out-of-date products.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Carrots and red peppers are packed with beta-carotene, which the body converts it to vitamin A - critical for the development of your baby's eyes, skin, bones and organs. They're also a good source of vitamins B6 and C, plus fiber to keep things moving. Both are perfect for munching on the go, with or without dip. Carrots also shred neatly into almost anything (from salads to meatloaf to cakes to muffins). And sweet red peppers are perfect in salsa, stir-fries and pasta dishes; or roast (with a little olive oil, garlic, and lemon) and add to sandwiches, salads or antipastos.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Good news if your stomach does flips at just the thought of veggies: mangos contain more vitamins A and C bite for delicious bite than a salad. It's a perfect complement to both sweet and savory dishes. Blend it into smoothies or soups, chop it up in salsas or relishes, simply scoop and enjoy.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Vitamin B6 has been thought to help with morning sickness, although a Cochrane review (2015) of popular interventions did not find persuasive evidence that it works. However, B6 also helps your body to use and store energy from your food, and produce red blood cells. Many foods are excellent sources of vitamin B6, such as bananas, brown rice, lean meats, poultry, fish, avocados, whole grains, corn, and nuts. </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Vitamin B12 or cobalamin is also an important nutrient in pregnancy. You only need small amounts of this vitamin to keep you healthy. But if you have very low levels, you can develop anemia or even damage your nervous system. If you eat meat or dairy products then you're unlikely to be lacking in vitamin B12. If you are a vegan, you will either need to include plenty of foods that are fortified with vitamin B12, or take a supplement. Some brands of soya or other substitute milks (almond, cashew, rice, or coconut milk), some breakfast cereals and yeast extract are fortified with vitamin B12.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Oats are full of fiber, B vitamins, iron and a host of other minerals. Along with other complex carbs, they're also packed with fiber (helpful if you're dealing with constipation). Fill your breakfast bowl with them, but don't stop there - add oats to pancakes, muffins, cakes, cookies, even meatloaf. Aim to eat plenty along with a variety of other whole grains (whole corn, rice, quinoa, wheat and barley) to up your dose of a slew of baby-building vitamins and minerals.</p>

<h3>Proteins</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Protein is nature's ultimate pick-me-up. It provides you with the kind of energy that keeps you going - instead of leaving you flat in the middle of the day. Better still, the amino acids in protein-rich foods will also aid in the development of your baby's rapidly reproducing cells. You need 75 grams of it per day when you're expecting - and luckily, most people get that much protein each day without even trying (especially if they picked up the high-protein habit while doing low-carb diets). You can pack it all in (and more) by eating just one 24-ounce steak, but that's not the best way to get your protein high during pregnancy. First, it's tough to chew your way through so much meat when you're exhausted (and nauseated). Second, digesting a large amount of food (especially when it's high in fat) takes energy you don't have and can make you more fatigued. Third, it's best to get your protein fixes (and all your nutrient fixes) in small bites, literally - grazing on five or six small meals a day is a much more efficient way of keeping your energy on an even keel. </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">High-protein foods also keep your hunger at bay by stabilizing your blood sugar, which is why you should aim for three servings (that's about 75 grams) of protein per day. Lean meat is an excellent option, since it's also high in iron, critical to help your baby develop his red blood cell supply and support yours, too (blood volume can increase by as much as 50 percent when you're pregnant, which is why anemia during pregnancy is so common). Iron also helps build baby's brain by strengthening nerve connections. A little goes a long way, so add a bit of beef, pork or lamb to veggie-filled soups, salads and rice or noodle dishes.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Lentils also boast protein, vitamin B6 and iron. Plus they're the most intestine (and spouse) friendly legume which readily absorbs a variety of flavors from other foods and seasonings. Eat as a side dish or toss into salads, soups and stews.</p>

<h3>Iron</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Fatigue, especially if it's really keeping a good pregnant woman down, can be related to iron-deficiency anemia, especially as pregnancy progresses and the demands of blood making start to take their toll. Making sure you get some iron-rich foods daily (as well as an iron supplement after week 20) will keep your irons stores elevated and help pump up your energy level. You can find iron from these healthy sources: iron-fortified cereals, dried fruit, spinach, soy products, lean red meat, duck, shellfish, cooked dried beans.</p>

<h3>Calcium</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Your baby needs calcium  for his growing bones, and you need it to keep yours strong and to help your muscles and nerves function. Aim for about 1,200 mg (that's four servings) every day. One of your best bets? Yogurt: cup for cup, it contains as much calcium as milk - plus it's packed with protein and folate. The active cultures (i.e., good bacteria) in yogurt can also help prevent stomach upset as well as yeast infections (which are more common in pregnancy). Blend yogurt with fruit into smoothies, layer with granola in a breakfast parfait, substitute for sour cream or mayo in sandwich fillings, dips and salad dressings, or simply spoon it out of the carton.</p>

<h3>Fats</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Cold-water fish like salmon is packed with omega-3 essential fatty acids, most importantly a type called DHA. These healthy fats are "essential" for a number of reasons: The body can't make them on its own, they help metabolize fat-soluble vitamins like A and E, they may help reduce the risk of prenatal depression, and they're critical for the development of your baby's eyes and brain (both the brain and retina are primarily composed of DHA). The Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency encourage pregnant women to eat 8 to 12 ounces (two to three servings) of fish every week. Opt for wild salmon, sardines, herring and farmed oysters, which are all high in omega 3s and safe for pregnancy. Cook or serve it up with acidic ingredients like sour cream, fruit salsa or lemon juice. </p> 

<h3>Water</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">OK, it's not technically a food - but getting enough is just as important to your health as any nutrient. Water has lots of benefits for you and your growing baby: building new cells, delivering nutrients, flushing toxins and more. Water also makes your tummy feel full, so you're less tempted to reach for chips or cookies, and it can help with constipation during pregnancy. Plus the dangers of dehydration are real: It can up the risk of early labor. So fill up one of those stainless-steel water bottles and take it wherever you go.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Water from all sources counts (100 percent juice, milk, soup, tea), so don't stress too much if two quarts a day of plain water is, well, too much to swallow. Focus instead on total fluid intake.</p>

<div id="third" class="container" style="background:#e2c3d2;">
<h2>Dietary guidelines for week: 13 to 16</h2>
              <hr style="color:green;border:3px solid green;">              
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <img alt="first trimester" src="resources/Images/diet13to16.jpg">
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <br>
              <p style="font-size:120%;font-style: oblique;">Making time for regular pit stops of good nutrition helps your body cope better with whatever symptom pregnancy's throwing your way (from morning sickness to constipation, and everything in between). They're especially important when it comes to fighting fatigue, since they keep blood sugar levels and your energy up as running on empty stomach makes it hard to run around.</p>
<h3>Multivitamins</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">You can get plenty of vitamins from fresh fruits and vegetables. Try to eat five portions of a variety of fruits and vegetables every day. Eat raw vegetables or steam them instead of boiling them. This will help you to make the most of the vitamins vegetables contain.
You could also take a pregnancy multivitamin with at least 16 to 20 mg of iron, but don't use this as a substitute for fruits and vegetables. Some women need even more iron so it's best to check with your midwife or doctor about the amount of iron you should be taking during your pregnancy.
Some multivitamins contain 27 mg of iron, more than the recommended daily amount, and that's okay for pregnancy too. The only concern you may face from having a higher than recommended amount of iron is constipation.</p>

<h3>Folic acid</h3> 
<p style="font-size:120%;">Your baby's nervous system and spinal cord are among the first things to develop, and folic acid (aka folate), found naturally in whole grains, green leafy vegetables, beans, bananas, broccoli, and milk, and added via fortification to breads and cereals, is essential to neural development. Which is why it's recommended that you eat folic-acid-rich foods and begin taking a supplement containing folic acid even before you become pregnant and that you continue to focus on folate throughout your pregnancy. The recommended amount of folic acid is 400 mcg before pregnancy and 600 mcg once you are pregnant. Make sure your prenatal vitamin contains that amount.</p>

<h3>Iron</h3> 

<p style="font-size:120%;">When you're making a baby, you're in the blood-making business big time. Since iron helps generate blood supply, it's a nutrient you'll need plenty of to keep your body's and your baby's supply of red in the black. Ensure your intake of this vital mineral by eating such iron-rich foods as beef, duck, soy products, spinach, potatoes (with the skins on), and dried fruits. Your practitioner will probably also suggest a supplement after week 20 to keep your iron up as blood demand steps up.
Regardless of where you are getting your iron from (either food or supplements) taking iron at the same time as foods containing lots of calcium reduces the absorption of the iron but combining non-heme (vegetarian) sources of iron with vitamin C increases the iron absorption. </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">In other words, don't make that yummy spinach salad with feta cheese, make it with tomatoes or tangerines instead. And don't drink a glass of milk with your iron supplements; drink the supplement with a glass of orange juice! Also watch out for tea and coffee since the tannins in both can interfere with the absorption of iron. It's best to have these drinks an hour or two between meals.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">You can also become anemic if you don't have enough iron. Women who are anemic are at a much higher risk of postpartum hemorrhage after delivering their babies. Additionally, women who suffer from anemia may have delayed or reduced breast milk. They may also take longer to recover following delivery and be tired for longer than expected. </p>

<h3>Calcium</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">It does a growing baby body good, building strong bones and teeth. But calcium also does your body good, too - helping to maintain solid bone density and prevent osteoporosis later in life, and lowering your risk of preeclampsia now. So make sure you "got milk" and other calcium-loaded foods, like fortified juice, almonds, sesame seeds, soy products, green leafies, sardines, canned salmon with bones, and broccoli.</p>

<h3>Vitamin C</h3> 
<p style="font-size:120%;">Vitamin C is essential for the production of collagen, which gives strength to your baby's cartilage, muscles, blood vessels, and bones. It also gives his or her body the ability to repair wounded tissue. And if that's not enough, adequate doses of vitamin C have been linked to a healthy birth weight and a decreased risk of premature rupture of the membranes. Since vitamin C can't be stored, you'll need to make sure you get enough servings daily. You can get your C with the old standard — orange juice - as well as from a wide variety of delicious fruits (mango, papaya, cantaloupe, and strawberries) and veggies (including red peppers, broccoli, collard greens, and vegetable juice).</p>

<h3>Vitamin D</h3> 
<p style="font-size:120%;">Most of your vitamin D supply comes from the sun or milk. If you don't drink the white stuff or spend much time outdoors, you'll need to find your D from other sources. That's because vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy teeth and bone structure, plus it helps you absorb calcium (and you already know why you need to absorb plenty of that). Get your D from canned sardines, fortified milk and orange juice, and egg yolk. And get a few minutes of sun each day (when weather permits).</p>

<h3>DHA</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Your baby needs some fat — especially essential fats (that's why they're called essential), like omega-3 fatty acids. DHA, one of those omega-3s, is a major component of the human brain and retina — and your baby's developing brain and eyes need a healthy dose of DHA each day. Get DHA from such oily fish as trout, anchovies, sardines, or wild salmon, as well as from DHA eggs. </p>

<h2>Dietary guidelines for week: 17 to 20</h2>
              <hr style="color:green;border:3px solid green;">

              <br>
              <p style="font-size:120%;font-style: oblique;">You may not have put on much weight during the first trimester, but your weight should steadily increase during the second trimester as your baby grows. </p>
<h3>Omega 3 fatty acids</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Omega 3 fatty acids are important in pregnancy for your baby's brain and eye development. Oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring and sardines are good sources. Aim to have at least two portions a week. If you're a vegetarian, you can get omega 3 fatty acids from foods such as tofu, soya beans, flax seeds, walnuts, leafy green vegetables, eggs, milk, cheese and sesame seeds. You could also try a supplement derived from algae.</p>

<h3>Iron </h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Your blood volume increases by nearly 50 percent during pregnancy to support you and your developing baby - and iron is required to produce more red blood cells. Not getting enough? Low iron can result in anemia, which, left untreated, may also lead to preterm labor and low birth weight. Vegetarians and vegans aren't alone in needing to be conscious of iron levels during pregnancy. Even red-meat eaters have a hard time getting enough from their diets while expecting. One simple way to get what you need is to take an iron supplement, which your practitioner may recommend in addition to your prenatal vitamin after week 20 (or earlier, if routine testing shows your iron stores are low). It's a good idea to also chow down on iron-rich foods.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">How Much: About 27 mg</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">Foods to Eat: Beans, Edamame, Soy products, Oat bran, Barley, Quinoa, Bulgur, Pumpkin seeds, Dried fruit, Spinach, collard greens or kale, Seaweed</p>

<h3>Vitamin B12</h3> 
<p style="font-size:120%;">Vitamin B12 partners with folic acid to help with proper fetal brain development; it's also important for the formation of red blood cells and for building genetic material. A deficiency has been linked to neural tube defects as well as increased risk of preterm labor. Though B12 deficiencies are rare, vegetarians and particularly vegans often don't get enough of this vitamin, since it's found only in foods that come from animals. Ask your practitioner if you need more than what's provided in your prenatal vitamin; she can recommend a supplemental B12 as well as folic acid - and ensure you're not getting too much of a good thing.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">How Much: 2.6 mcg per day</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">Foods to Eat: Vitamin B12-fortified soy milk, Fortified cereals, Nutritional yeast, Fortified meat substitutes</p>

<h3>Vitamin D</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">This vital vitamin plays a role in building and maintaining healthy teeth and bones. Severe deficiency has been linked to complications including congenital rickets (a condition that causes the bones to become soft and weak, leading to poor growth and skeletal deformities) as well as bone fractures in newborns. The best dietary sources of vitamin D are milk and fish.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Your baby needs a good supply of vitamin D and calcium to help make healthy teeth and bones. Health Canada recommends that all pregnant or nursing moms drink at least two cups of vitamin D fortified milk each day. In addition to being a good source of omega 3 fatty acids, fish are also a good dietary source of vitamin D. 
Moderate exposure to the sun also generates vitamin D, although this should be balanced against increasing your risk of skin cancer. Just half an hour a day is enough to get all the vitamin D you need, so don't overdo it. Wearing sun protection lotion is essential for the health of your skin, and will not stop your body absorbing this vital vitamin.</p>

<h3>Calcium</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Calcium is important for nerve transmission and muscle contraction, as well as for healthy teeth and bones. Since you are supplying calcium to your baby for her skeleton, make sure that you are eating plenty of calcium-rich foods, especially dairy foods and canned fish with bones.  Calcium is also key for building your baby's bones, muscles, heart and nerves, especially during the third trimester. In fact, it's so essential to his development that what he doesn't get from what you eat, he'll take from your bones, potentially putting you at risk of osteoporosis later in life. </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Luckily, dairy products aren't the only options for getting your daily recommended amounts. During pregnancy, the body becomes more efficient in absorbing calcium from food. But it's still a good idea to eat plenty of calcium-rich foods, especially as it can help lower your risk of pre-eclampsia. </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">These foods are all rich in calcium: Almonds, Apricots (dried), Baked beans, Cheese, Chickpeas, Canned fish (with bones), Milk (including fortified soya milk), Tahini, Tofu, Spinach, Yogurt</p>

<h2>Dietary guidelines for week: 21 to 24</h2>
              <hr style="color:green;border:3px solid green;">              
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <img alt="second trimester" src="resources/Images/diet21to24.jpg">
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <br>
              <p style="font-size:120%;font-style: oblique;">Out of your own kitchen, you may sometimes be faced with dietary concerns that you haven't considered before. Many of the uncertainties for moms-to-be revolve around which foods are safe to eat.</p>
<h3>Vitamin A</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">You need vitamin A during pregnancy and at other times. It is important for night vision, cell growth, healthy skin and red blood cell production. Vitamin A exists in our food in two forms, retinol and beta-carotene. Both are good for your health, but retinol is much stronger, and during pregnancy too much of it can harm a developing baby.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Retinol is in egg yolk, butter, margarine and milk, all of which are fine to eat during pregnancy. Liver is very high in the retinol form of vitamin A so it's best not to eat this when you are pregnant. </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Dark green and orange-yellow fruits and vegetables are good sources of beta-carotene. Also, try some of these suggestions while you are pregnant: Carrots, Pumpkin and squash, Sweet potatoes, Papaya, mangos, oranges, cantaloupe, pink grapefruit, Broccoli, Greens including watercress, collard greens, kale, turnip greens, beet greens, cabbage and spinach.</p>

<h3>Iron</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Many women pop supplements when they get their period, knowing it will make them feel more energetic. That's because your menstrual blood is rich in iron (actually, all blood is rich in iron), and running low on iron during pregnancy can make you feel like you're running on empty, especially at 21 weeks pregnant. Now that you're having a nine-month (or likely much longer) period reprieve, though, you still don't get to put those iron pills away. Even though you're not losing iron-rich blood through menstruation, you're making lots more red blood cells - and you've got to be pumped with iron to do that (as well as to feel "strong to the finish" of pregnancy). And your need for iron during pregnancy has never been greater than it is right now.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">By week 20 in your pregnancy, your stored iron supply (the one you saved up when your periods stopped) is just about depleted - right at the time that your growing baby is most in the market for new red blood cells. This puts you at risk for anemia during pregnancy, or low iron levels. Although all pregnant women are susceptible to anemia, those who have had other recent pregnancies, are carrying more than one fetus, or have been undernourished at any point during their pregnancies have an even greater risk.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Anemia is never fun - it takes away your lovely pregnancy glow, making you pale, extremely weak, easily tired or breathless, and can sometimes even lead to fainting.Taking a 30 to 50 mg iron supplement during the crucial second half of your pregnancy will ensure that you're getting what you and your baby need. (If your practitioner notes that your iron stores are particularly low, he or she may recommend a higher dosage supplement.) Remember that during pregnancy, an iron supplement should be taken in addition to your prenatal vitamins. Be certain to talk to your practitioner about the best time of day to take your vitamin so it's not hard on your tummy.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">If spinach isn't appealing (though think out of the can here - you can also serve spinach up fresh in a salad with sliced strawberries, wilted under seared fish or grilled meat, or sauteed with pasta and cheese), there are lots of other iron-rich foods you can pump your diet up with, including lean beef or buffalo, duck, cooked dried beans, edamame and other soy products, oat bran, barley, dried fruit, Jerusalem artichokes, and seaweed. Sardines, clams, oysters, mussels, and shrimp also contain a lot of iron, but pregnant women need to be cautious about seafood and fish during pregnancy because of the mercury content. These seafoods have low levels of mercury, but limit your intake to 12 ounces a week at most. Also, be especially careful not to eat raw seafood - for example, clams, oysters, and mussels must be cooked until their shells open, and shrimp must be cooked until it's milky white.</p>

<h3>Vitamin C</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Vitamin C is iron's best bud, since it's well known to improve iron absorption. So take a glass of OJ with that iron supplement during pregnancy, a side of red pepper with those shrimp, or some fresh strawberries in your oat bran cereal.</p>

<h3>Organic Foods</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Now that you're eating for two, you may be wondering whether if and when you should opt for organic foods. Organics, after all, are more expensive than non-organic, or conventional, food - but naturally you want to do everything possible to give your baby the best start to life. There's also a "Clean 15" list of those fruits and vegetables with the lowest pesticide amounts. These are foods where buying conventional is totally fine: Avocados, Sweet corn, Pineapples, Cabbage, Sweet peas (frozen), Onions, Asparagus, Mangoes, Papayas, Kiwi, Eggplant, Grapefruit, Cantaloupe (domestic), Cauliflower, Sweet potatoes.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Organic grass-fed meat, which in addition to being free of antibiotics has been shown to be lower in calories and fat and higher in protein than conventional meat. Organic, free-range poultry and eggs, since free-range chickens are also less likely to carry salmonella (because they aren't kept in cramped, disease-breeding quarters)</p>

<h2>Dietary guidelines for week: 25 to 28</h2>
              <hr style="color:green;border:3px solid green;">              
              <div class="col-md-13">

              <br>
              <p style="font-size:120%;font-style: oblique;">Rare is the pregnant woman who isn't time-challenged these days and challenged by the prospect of eating well while running the 14-hour marathon that's called daily life. When there are so many other items competing for your time and attention - it's a whole lot tougher.<p style="font-size:120%;">
	<h3>Water</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Your thirst is a good guide for how much to drink while pregnant - drink more in hot weather and when you are active, but Dietitians of Canada say that you should aim for 2.3 litres (about 9½ cups) of fluid each day.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Try to make sure water forms the main part of your daily fluid intake. As well as keeping you hydrated, water is important during pregnancy as it helps carry nutrients through your blood to your baby. Drinking water also helps prevent urinary tract infections, constipation and hemorrhoids, all common during pregnancy. If your body is retaining water, remember that the more water you drink, the less water your body will retain.</p>


<h3>Calcium</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Calcium helps your baby to grow strong bones and teeth, and helps to develop a healthy nervous system, heart, and muscles. Some excellent sources of calcium are: Milk and other dairy products including yogurt and cheese, Canned salmon with bones, Broccoli, Almonds, Orange juice and soy beverages that have been fortified with calcium, Dried figs, White beans.</p>

<h3>Vitamin D</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Vitamin D helps your body to absorb calcium. Vitamin D is made naturally in our bodies by exposure to sunlight, but we can get it from food too. It's recommended that you take a supplement of 600 IU (15 mcg) of vitamin D every day during pregnancy. If you are already taking a pregnancy multivitamin, check to see if it contains this amount of vitamin D. In addition you can eat these foods rich in vitamin D: Oily fish like salmon and mackerel, Vitamin D fortified drinks including milk, soy and rice beverages, and margarine, Eggs and organ meats.</p>


<h3>Fish</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">In 2014 and again 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released joint statements encouraging moms to eat more pregnancy-safe fish. The groups said that expecting and breastfeeding women should eat 8 to 12 ounces (that's two to three servings) of low-mercury fish every week.
Despite the long list of fish to limit during pregnancy, the vast majority of fish you'll find in the store and at restaurants are considered safe to eat when you're expecting at two to three servings (that's 8 to 12 ounces) per week. These include wild salmon, shrimp, catfish, tilapia, sole, flounder, haddock, halibut, ocean perch, pollock, cod, canned light tuna, crab, crawfish, lobster, hake, clams, black sea bass, anchovies and trout. The advantages of eating fish are:</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">1.Fish is a first-rate source of lean protein, an essential amino acid that helps create all of baby's cells - from skin and muscle to hair and bones.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">2.Is good for baby's brain. What's more, fish (especially the fattier varieties, like salmon) is a source of the omega-3 fatty acid DHA, which has been shown to boost baby brain power. It's more important than ever in the third trimester, when your baby's brain growth is fast and furious.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">3. Boosts your memory. Speaking of boosted brain power, getting enough omega-3s may also improve your memory - especially helpful when you're battling a case of pregnancy </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">4.Improves your mood: An adequate intake of omega-3 fatty acids and especially DHA has been shown to decrease your risk of depression during pregnancy as well as postpartum depression.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">5. Supports your heart: A diet rich in fish may lower your risk of cardiac disease by reducing blood clotting and levels of triglycerides (blood fat) as well as lowering blood pressure if you have preexisting hypertension.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">6. May reduce risk of preterm birth. Scientists have observed that rates of preterm birth are lower in areas with a high fish intake - and some studies have indeed linked adequate omega 3 intake (whether through fish or supplements) to a lower risk of preterm birth.</p>

<h2>Dietary guidelines for week: 29 to 32</h2>
              <hr style="color:green;border:3px solid green;">              
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <img alt="third trimester" src="resources/Images/diet29to32.jpg">

              <br>
              <p style="font-size:120%;	font-style: oblique;">With the pregnancy pounds piling on at 29 weeks pregnant (as they should be), is fat the last word you feel like hearing right now? </p>
<h3>Iron Intake</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">As your pregnancy progresses, you need more iron. Health Canada (2009) recommends that pregnant women take a daily supplement containing 16-20 mg of iron throughout the pregnancy because most of us have trouble getting enough. It is even harder for vegetarians! </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Good sources of iron for vegetarians include fortified breakfast cereals, tofu, wholegrain bread, dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, and dried fruits. Iron from non-meat sources is less well-absorbed than iron from meat, so you may need to be taking a supplement to be sure you get enough. Some women need even more, so it is important to check with your midwife or doctor to make sure. </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">When you eat iron-rich vegetarian food, be sure to add a source of vitamin C (e.g. a squeeze of lemon, some tomatoes, citrus fruits), as it increases your body's absorption of this sort of iron. And don't consume sources of calcium at the same time as the iron, as that will reduce your iron absorption. The tannins in coffee and tea can likewise interfere with iron absorption, so have them between meals instead. </p>

<h3>Fats</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, most notably DHA (known in scientific circles as docosahexaenoic acid). While omega-3s are healthy additions to any diet (they lower cholesterol and blood pressure, reducing the risk of heart disease), they're particularly smart selections when you're building a baby. DHA, for instance, is a vital ingredient in brain and retinal tissue, so it's essential for proper brain growth and eye development in fetuses and young babies. During the third trimester, brain growth is at its peak - and it continues to grow during the first year of life, tripling in size by the time your baby is a year old. This means that your baby's need for this must-have nutrient will skyrocket (the brain's DHA content must multiply by three to five times during these busy three months).</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">But a DHA-heavy diet can be a little tricky to follow, since so many fish are off-limits when you're expecting. Luckily, DHA is found in safe-to-savor cold water, fatty fishes such as salmon (always choose wild when you can) and cod. Try DHA-rich eggs, sometimes called omega-3 eggs. They're laid by chickens on a DHA-supplemented diet - it'll say so on the package. Regular egg yolks contain a small amount of DHA, too. Vegans, fear not - algae is an all-natural plant source of DHA, so you can incorporate foods like seaweed into your diet.</p>

<div id="eighth" class="container" style="background:#e2c3d2;">
<h2>Dietary guidelines for week: 33 to 36</h2>
              <hr style="color:green;border:3px solid green;">              
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <img alt="third trimester" src="resources/Images/diet33to36.jpg">
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <br>
              <p style="font-size:120%;font-style: oblique;">If you are suffering from heartburn or indigestion, try cutting out rich, fatty or spicy foods, chocolate, citrus fruits, and coffee. Have small, frequent meals, and take your time over your meals. Eat slowly, have small mouthfuls and chew your food well. To ease bloating, sit up straight while you're eating, and don't lie down for at least half an hour after a meal. </p>
	<h3>Vitamin K</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">All babies are given vitamin K because it plays an important role in making blood clot. A very small number of newborn babies (about 1 in 10,000) suffer from vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). This is called hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN). These babies don't have enough vitamin K. </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">You can make sure you get plenty of vitamin K from foods such as green leafy vegetables, cantaloupe, cauliflower, green beans, wholegrain bread and pasta. It may be helpful to have vitamin K now and during the first weeks with your baby, particularly if you are breastfeeding. The first breastfeeds of colostrum are rich in vitamin K. Some vitamin K rich foods are: Broccoli, Soybeans, Dark leafy greens including spinach, kale, collards, turnip greens and beet greens.</p>

<h3>Calcium Supplements</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">If your body has trouble producing enough lactase - the enzyme that breaks down the lactose in milk, then an encounter with dairy, especially in its most basic form (milk's as close to the cow as it comes) can lead to cramps, gas, bloating, and diarrhea.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Keep in mind that skipping the milk means missing not only its calcium but also its buddy, vitamin D. Yogurt and cheese might be good sources of calcium, but they don't contain the big D. Luckily, getting your D is as easy as soaking up the sun for a few minutes a day (your body manufactures it in response to sunlight). Check, too, that the sunshine vitamin is in your prenatal tablet. If you're drinking soy milk, look for a brand that's enriched with Vitamin D.</p>

<h3>Water</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Ever wonder how all the good stuff in the prenatal vitamins and healthy foods you're faithfully consuming every day are shipped to your fetus? It all starts with water, which helps your body absorb essential nutrients into the cells and transports vitamins, minerals and hormones to the blood cells. It's those nutrient-rich blood cells that reach the placenta and ultimately your baby - all with the help of H2O.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">You'll need more water to keep your system running for two during pregnancy. The Institute of Medicine says pregnant women in temperate climates should aim to drink 12 or 13 glasses (they count a glass as eight ounces) each day, which is slightly more than the amount for non-pregnant women (around 11 glasses each day). Try to space out your sips to keep them coming steadily throughout the day rather than gulping a lot at once, which could leave you feeling uncomfortably full. Since most of us don't drink enough fluids, filling a water bottle or two every morning and keeping it handy all day takes the hassle out of hydration. Be sure to sip before, during and after you work out, or if you find yourself outside on a hot day. Note, too, that if you feel thirsty, it's a sign that your body is already on its way to being dehydrated.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">There are plenty of other liquids that make the cut: Milk (an 8-ounce glass of skim yields just over seven ounces of water), sparkling or flavored waters, fruit and vegetable juices (watch out for added sugar in fruit juice and added sodium in veggie drinks) and decaffeinated teas are all great choices, just be sure you keep an eye on pasteurization, calorie info and all that. You should, however, limit your intake of soda , as well as other beverages containing caffeine, since they have a diuretic effect.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Keep in mind, too, that about 20 percent of our daily water intake comes from food sources. Fruits pack the most water: One cup of watermelon or cantaloupe provides just under five ounces of water; a medium-size pear or one cup of strawberries provides about four and a half ounces; a medium size orange has four ounces. A cup of chicken soup yields roughly six ounces of water.</p>

<div id="ninth" class="container" style="background:#e2c3d2;">
<h2>Dietary guidelines for week: 37 to 40+</h2>
              <hr style="color:green;border:3px solid green;">              
              <div class="col-md-13">
              <img alt="third trimester" src="resources/Images/diet37to42.jpg">

              <div class="col-md-13">
              <br>
              <p style="font-size:120%;font-style: oblique;">Use the next few weeks to make batches of food to freeze. Having a supply of healthy meals will give you one less thing to worry about after your baby is born. </p>
	<h3>Proteins</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Protein is made up of the amino acids that build your baby's adorable face and every cell below it. At 37 weeks pregnant, your baby's brain, in particular, needs these raw materials to transform itself into the wondrous organ that will help your baby breathe, walk, talk, and gleefully flush your car keys down the toilet in the years to come.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">During pregnancy, you need three servings of protein every day (the equivalent of about 75 grams). Getting your full protein quota is never more important than it is during this final trimester, when your baby's brain is developing fast and furiously - but it's also a great time to up your intake of good protein sources that are extra high in omega-3 fatty acids, like DHA - another must-have nutrient when it comes to baby brains plus one that's known to lower your risk of postpartum depression. Get protein during pregnancy from all of these foods, but the starred (*) ones are especially good sources of protein for their DHA star power: Lean meat,  Grass-fed lean meat, Poultry,Fish* (fatty fish, like wild salmon, anchovies, and sardines contain the most brain-boosting fatty acids, but all fish have some, Eggs* (choose DHA eggs for an omega-3 boost), Milk and other dairy products,Beans, Tofu and other soy products (such as edamame and soy pasta), Peanuts, peanut butter, other nuts and seeds (get the scoop on nuts during pregnancy), Wheat germ, Whole-grain baked goods, Whole grains — an especially high-protein variety is quinoa (pronounced keen-wa), Algae, like seaweed* (an all-natural plant source of DHA).</p>

<h3>Choline</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">This essential nutrient helps improve brain function and is the building block for a memory-forming brain chemical called acetylcholine. What's more, choline plays a crucial role in the development of your baby's brain - something occurring at a rapid clip now that you're in your third trimester. Researchers theorize that getting plenty of this brain boosting mineral during pregnancy can boost the cognitive function of both your baby - and you. Expectant moms are expected to get 450 mg of choline each day. You can easily get your share and more by eating such choline-rich foods as egg yolks (use DHA eggs to pack a memory-boosting omega-3 punch), beef, milk, soybeans (enjoy them in their crunchy roasted form or steamed in yummy green pods), citrus fruits, wheat germ, and nuts.</p>
