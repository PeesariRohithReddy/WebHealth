      <h1>How do I calculate my baby’s due date? </h1>
      <p>Congratulations on your pregnancy!<br>Now how do you know when you can expect your baby? The average pregnancy lasts 280 days from the last menstrual period, or more precisely, 266 days following your last ovulation cycle (or approximately 40 weeks).<br> 
   Remember this will be an estimate and not a definite certainty.</p>

      <h1>How much weight should I gain during pregnancy?</h1>
      <p>The amount of weight you should gain during pregnancy depends on your weight before you got pregnant. Your health care provider will advise you on a healthy weight gain based on your current weight, diet, and activity level.Typically, weight gain should be gradual throughout pregnancy, with a total of about 1 to 4 pounds in the first trimester and 2 to 4 pounds each month in the second and third trimesters.<br>
                     
                       In 2009, the Institute of Medicine released new recommendations for total weight gain during pregnancy, based on pre-pregnancybody mass index (BMI)   , a measure that combines height and weight. According to these recommendations:<br>
                       •	Women in a healthy weight range before getting pregnant should gain between 25 and 35 pounds.<br>
                       •	Women who are underweight or overweight before becoming pregnant may need to gain more or less.<br>
                       o	For underweight women with a BMI of less than 18.5, total weight gain should be between 28 and 40 pounds.<br>
                       o	Overweight women (BMI between 25 and 29.9) should gain between 15 and 25 pounds.<br>
                       o	Women with a BMI greater than 30 should gain between 11 and 20 pounds.<br></p>

      <h1>What can I do during pregnancy to help make sure my child is a healthy weight?</h1>
      <p>Research is starting to improve our understanding of the epidemic of obesity in the United States. Unfortunately, even young children are at risk for becoming obese, making them vulnerable to diabetes, heart disease, and other conditions throughout their life course.
                            The good news is that with better knowledge, actions can be taken to prevent the development of overweight and obesity—starting even before pregnancy. For example, the following steps can help ensure a healthy pregnancy and reduce the chance that a child will be overweight or obese:<br>
                            •	Women who are planning a pregnancy can take steps to achieve a healthy weight.<br>
                            •	Women who have diabetes (high blood sugar) can modify their lifestyle by achieving a healthy weight, engaging in physical activity, and getting their diabetes under control before they get pregnant.<br>
                            •	By getting regular prenatal care and tracking their weight gain during pregnancy, women can ensure that they gain the proper amount of weight while pregnant.<br>
                            •	Breastfeeding can help reduce the long-term risk that an infant will become obese or develop diabetes, high blood pressure, or high blood cholesterol levels in adulthood.<br>
                            •	Being at a healthy weight before pregnancy reduces the chances that a woman will develop gestational diabetes (high blood sugar that starts during pregnancy). Children whose mothers had gestational diabetes are at higher lifetime risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.<br> Gestational diabetes can also cause problems for the newborn, including dangerously low blood sugar, difficulty breathing at birth because of delayed lung maturation, neonatal liver disease, and large body size that may cause injuries at birth.<br>
                            •	By stopping smoking during pregnancy, women can reduce the chances that their infant will develop obesity during his or her lifetime.<br>
                            •	Breastfeeding an infant for at least 6 months and making sure that he or she gets enough sleep can also help increase the chances that he or she maintains a healthy weight for life.<br></p>

      <h1>Is it safe to take medications or supplements during pregnancy?</h1>
      <p>Medication use during pregnancy is common. In a study by the CDC, during the first trimester of pregnancy, 70% to 80% of women reported taking at least one medication,and as many as 50% took four or more medications.10
Certain medications can be unsafe, however. Talk to your health care provider about the medications you currently take.Tell him or her about prescription and over-the-counter medications as well as dietary or herbal supplements. Certain types of medications for treating acne as well as herbal and dietary supplements can harm the developing fetus. Even ibuprofen or aspirin can cause problems in pregnancy, particularly during the last three months.11
Many women take medications to treat health problems during pregnancy like diabetes, asthma, heartburn, and morning sickness.Other women take medications to treat conditions they had before they became pregnant. Often, your health care provider will encourage you to continue taking your medication. However, in some cases, a safer alternative may be available.</p>

      <h1>What can I do to prevent this nasty heartburn?</h1>
      <p>Heartburn plagues most expecting women due to a growing uterus and progesterone, a hormone that relaxes muscles (including the stomach valve) to ready the body for pregnancy—both allowing acid into the esophagus.
   However, you can use certain tricks,such as eating smaller and more frequent meals, taking a walk after meals, keeping the head and chest elevated while you sleep, wearing loose clothing, sipping ginger root tea, and taking antacids to alleviate indigestion and gas.</p>

      <h1>How can I prevent stretch marks?</h1>
      <p>Approximately 90-percent of pregnant women develop stretch marks as their body grows during pregnancy on the stomach, thighs, buttocks, and breasts. 
   You don’t have to be in the majority! You can do your part to prevent stretch marks by drinking lots of water to keep skin hydrated, by massaging your skin daily with a moisturizer or oil that’s high in vitamin A and vitamin E (i.e., cocoa butter) to prevent stretch marks, and increase circulation and tissue repair; and by consuming a diet that’s rich in skin-supporting vitamins—E, C, A, and zinc.</p>

      <h1>What unique challenges do pregnant women with disabilities face?</h1>
      <p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, an estimated one in five American women have a disability.12 Most women with disabilities can have healthy pregnancies and deliver healthy babies, especially if they have a health care team that is knowledgeable about their disability.<br> However, in a national study, many women reported difficulty finding health care providers and hospitals that had experience managing pregnancies with their disability.13
                            Women with disabilities face many of the same health problems, including weight gain and fatigue, as other pregnant women. However, these problems can be more serious or lead to other complications in women with disabilities. Other challenges faced by women with disabilities may include13:<br>
                            •	More problems with bladder function, such as infections and leakage. An increase in infections could lead to pregnancy loss,preterm labor, and a low-birth-weight infant.<br>
                            •	Breathing difficulties and pneumonia, particularly for women who have breathing problems before pregnancy.<br>
                            •	Worsening of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) following delivery. One study shows that this occurs within 1 month of delivery in as many as 30% of pregnant women with MS.<br>
                            •	Increased seizures in women who experience seizures already as a result of a traumatic brain injury.<br>
                            •	Autonomic dysreflexia (a severe, sudden rise in blood pressure). The risk of autonomic dysreflexia is increased for pregnant women with spinal cord injuries.<br></p>

      <h1>Is it safe to have sex when pregnant?</h1>
      <p>Typically, sex is perfectly safe in pregnancy—right up until delivery. So put aside your fears that intercourse will hurt your baby. The amniotic sac, the uterus, and the mucus plug in the cervix all provide strong protection your baby. However, there some instances where your doctor may tell you to abstain from intercourse altogether while pregnant, such as if you risk premature labor, or if you suffer from placenta previa (the placenta is too close to the cervix), or vaginal bleeding.</p>

      <h1>How important is it to take prenatal vitamins?</h1>
      <p>Prenatal vitamins are vital in the wake of the increased demands of pregnancy. Growing a new person isn’t easy on your body, and you will require additional vitamins and minerals in your diet—like folic acid, calcium, and iron—for a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby. Rather than just selecting a prenatal vitamin yourself, talk to your doctor or midwife about if you need a special formulation (i.e., in cases of anemia or nutritional deficiencies), and if a tablet, capsule, or liquid prenatal vitamin will work most efficiently.

      <h1>Which types of fitness activities are safe for pregnant women?</h1>
      <p>You no longer have to swear off exercise during your pregnancy. There are ways to stay active, fit, and safe while you await the arrival of your little bundle of joy. Unless your doctor advises otherwise, gentle, low impact exercise—such as low gravity swimming, aqua aerobics, walking, jogging (if you did it before your pregnancy), yoga, Pilates, tai chi, and dance are all totally safe. Just steer clear of activities with jumping or shaking movements, or contact sports that pose fall, collision, or injury risks.</p>

      <h1>Why is my doctor screening me for gestational diabetes? </h1>
      <p>Many doctors do routine tests for gestational diabetes for pregnant women who are older than 25-years-old, have a family history or ethnicity that is prone to the condition, are obese, have delivered a baby over 9-pounds in weight, or have had a previous instance of gestational diabetes with another pregnancy. The condition affects approximately 10-precent of all pregnancies and is caused by hormonal shifts that lead to glucose intolerance that can affect both mom and baby—just while pregnant.</p>

      <h1>How do I know when it’s time to go to the hospital?</h1>
      <p>This is the most common question for first-time parents (dads are always a little jumpy about the timing). Having been in contact with your doctor or midwife, they will coach you through the process and help alleviate your fears concerning hospital timing. If you don’t have an existing medical issue, hospital staff will typically send you home if you arrive too early.  Most new moms will be advised that it’s time to go to the hospital when contractions are 3-4 minutes apart, one-minute long, for at least one hour in duration.</p>

      <h1>What are the other signs that my labor has begun? </h1>
      <p>Following your water breaking and Braxton Hicks contractions (also called warm-up contractions), the primary signs that you are in labor include the following signs—loss of the mucous plug, the baby “dropping” into birth position, a nauseating feeling, and contractions (or tightening of the uterine muscles) that become closer together (5 to 6 minutes apart), longer in duration (about 45 seconds), and literally demand all of your focus and energy.</p>
